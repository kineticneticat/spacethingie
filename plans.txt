kinda like orbital mechanics of ksp with building of spEng/ss14?

likely never going to planet surfaces, but mining asteroids
asteroids will probably be marching cube;d

Stella - (sun)
Malort - roasty-toasty much metal greyish-maroon (its mercury, its just mercury)
Twain - liveable* (pollution)
Dubh - very dense cloud cover, basically permenantly night on surface (haha dubh = dark)
Brank Belt - yeah its uh,, an asteroid belt
Yellah - blue + rings (highly elliptical orbit, comes in to between malort&twain, and out to past bbb)
